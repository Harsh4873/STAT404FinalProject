Race Zwieg - 
Designed and implemented the permutation tests for the project. I first began by creating and calculating the test statistics for the repeated permutations.
This included allocating the appropriate group numbers, calculating the means for the groups, and using that data to calculate the test statistic.
Next, a ggplot histogram was created, overlayed with a density line to visualize the permutation and theoretucal sampling distribution.
Finally, these permutations were tested using test_that and a few example seeds and numbers. These tests all returned affirmative and correct.
