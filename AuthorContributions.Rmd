# Author Contributions

## Harsh Dave
Harsh focused on creating the Core Simulation Functions, including the design and coding of `simulation_of_binary_response`, `simulation_for_two_sample_data`, `calculate_the_difference_in_proportions`, `repeated_simulations_for_one_simulation`, and `visualize_theoretical_sampling_distribution`. Additionally, Harsh helped develop examples and tests for each of these functions in the resepctive places: 'tests.R' and 'Examples.Rmd'. Harsh also participated in the debugging process and contributed to the overall project design strategy.
