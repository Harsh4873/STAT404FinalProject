For each member list the major activities they contributed to: design, testing, function writing, documentation writing, example generation, debugging, etc... No more than one paragraph per group member (DELETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS and create a knitted document)


Race Zwieg - 
Designed and implemented the permutation tests for the project. I first began by creating and calculating the test statistics for the repeated permutations.
This included allocating the appropriate group numbers, calculating the means for the groups, and using that data to calculate the test statistic.
Next, a ggplot histogram was created, overlayed with a density line to visualize the permutation and theoretucal sampling distribution.
Finally, these permutations were tested using test_that and a few example seeds and numbers. These tests all returned affirmative and correct.




Christopher Coleman - 
Designed and implemented a function which runs the bootstrapping process on our data. I started with data validation ensuring our inputs were valid, even though they should be validated earlier. I then calculated sample statistics to get our theoretical values. After this, I implemented the bootstrapping algorithm, which is really just a simple loop randomly sampling from our gathered data and appending them all to one big list. We then return that list. The inputs outputs were tested using test_that, all of which passed as expected. Finally, I created the visualization function, which was just a simple ggplot showing the theoretical and calculated (bootstrap) confidence intervals.
