# Visualize Theoretical Sampling Distributions (Harsh Dave)

# The below content gives an example of how to use the functions in the package sim_funcs.R. Each section corresponds to a specific function with different scenarios to show the range of outputs.

# Core Simulation Functions

## simulation_of_binary_response

### Single Group Example

# Shows how to simulate binary responses with a single probability and sample size:
# simulation_of_binary_response(p = 0.5, n = 100)

### Additional Example

# Shows simulation with a different probability:
# simulation_of_binary_response(p = 0.7, n = 200) 

## simulation_for_two_sample_data

### Small Difference

# Simulates two samples with a small difference in proportions: 
# simulation_for_two_sample_data(p1 = 0.4, p2 = 0.45, n1 = 100, n2 = 100)

### Large Difference

# Simulates two samples with a significant difference in proportions: 
# simulation_for_two_sample_data(p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.7, n1 = 200, n2 = 200)

# calculate_the_difference_in_proportions

### Low difference

# Calculates the difference in proportions for a scenario with a low difference: 
# calculate_the_difference_in_proportions(p1 = 0.3, p2 = 0.35, n1 = 100, n2 = 100)

### Big difference

# Calculates the difference in proportions for a scenario with a big difference: 
# calculate_the_difference_in_proportions(p1 = 0.1, p2 = 0.6, n1 = 200, n2 = 200)

# repeated_simulations_for_one_simulation

# Small sample, few repetitions

# Runs simulations with small sample sizes and fewer repetitions: 
# repeated_simulations_for_one_simulation(p1 = 0.3, p2 = 0.4, n1 = 50, n2 = 50, rep_steps = c(10, 50, 100))

# Large sample, many repetitions 

# Runs simulations with large sample sizes and numerous repetitions: 
# repeated_simulations_for_one_simulation(p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.5, n1 = 500, n2 = 500, rep_steps = c(100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000))

# Sampling Distribution Visualization

# Small sample visualization

# Visualizes the sampling distribution for small samples: 
# visualize_theoretical_sampling_distribution(p1 = 0.3, p2 = 0.4, n1 = 50, n2 = 50)

# Visualizes the sampling distribution for large samples: 
# visualize_theoretical_sampling_distribution(p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.5, n1 = 500, n2 = 500)



# Confidence Analysis Examples (Ritvik V)

# The purpose of this package is to facilitate simulations and visualizations of statistical concepts related to confidence intervals and sampling distributions. The primary function, # visualize_confidence_levels, simulates repeated sampling for two groups with specified proportions and sample sizes. It calculates confidence intervals for the difference in # proportions and visualizes the proportion of intervals that capture the true difference.

# Simple Example:
# library(ggplot2)

# visualize_confidence_levels(
#  p1 = 0.6,  
#  p2 = 0.5,
#  n1 = 30,   
#  n2 = 30,   
#  rep_steps = c(10, 50, 100, 500, 1000))

# The expected output is a line plot showing the proportion of confidence intervals that include the true difference in proportions.

# Test Case for smaller sample sizes:

# Smaller sample sizes tend to have wider confidence intervals, making it harder for the intervals to contain the true difference.

# Example:
# visualize_confidence_levels(
#  p1 = 0.6, p2 = 0.5,
#  n1 = 10, n2 = 10,
#  rep_steps = c(10, 50, 100, 500, 1000))

# This plot will show slower convergence to the theoretical level compared to larger sample sizes.

# Test Case for different significance values:

# Changing the significance level affects the width of the confidence intervals. Smaller significance results in more conservative intervals.

# Example:

# visualize_confidence_levels(
#  p1 = 0.6, p2 = 0.5,
#  n1 = 30, n2 = 30,
#  rep_steps = c(10, 50, 100, 500, 1000),
#  alpha = 0.01)

# We can expect the proportions to converge to 99%

# Error handling examples:

# invalid proportions:
# visualize_confidence_levels(p1 = 1.5, p2 = 0.5, n1 = 30, n2 = 30, rep_steps = c(10, 50))
# The error is that proportions p1 and p2 must be between 0 and 1

# negative sample size:
# visualize_confidence_levels(p1 = 0.6, p2 = 0.5, n1 = -30, n2 = 30, rep_steps = c(10, 50))
# The error is that sample sizes n1 and n2 must be positive integers
